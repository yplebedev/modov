 Modpack for minecarft
 
 Hey, i got into Modpack development, but i am _not_ a professianal
 I just started, and the Modpack doesn't even work, most likely.
 It whould mean the world to me if you contributed and fixed something that i done wrong :D
 
 Anyway, I am doing the thing solo, and all of my previous projects i've done in a team, so only side contributers can help.
